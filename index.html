</li>
<li><p>why do you think some sports are so popular?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First, most sports such playing basketball or football are very beneficial for people’s health. People in the modern life barely have time to excercise themselves too much as before. For example, when they go outside, they would drive or take the subway. If they are hungry, sometimes they would just order takeouts and the food will be sent in front of them. So doing sports it’s a very good way to help people stay healthy. Also, it is a very good way to communicate with others. </p>

<p>New Zealand’s breath-taking natural beauty attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors every year.</p>
<p>To young people, it is. The economy of my hometown is booming. Tons of job opportunities are provided due to the industrial and commercial development there. Young people can easily find their positions in this city. Furthermore, there are also many places for entertainment like the pubs, cinemas, theaters and so on. However, I do not think it’s a good place for the senior. With the development of the local industries, environmental pollution has become more and more severe in recent years. I’m afraid it’s really bad for old people’s health, especially to those sick ones. </p>
<p>The most important thing you gain when you learn a language is that you establish what is called a bridge between your mother tongue and the target language. This bridge is essential in communication and mutual understanding among diverse nations and varied cultures. When you learn a certain new language you will soon find out that you expose yourself to a different culture, a different method of thinking and a different heritage. This brand new concept will give its contribution to widening your scope of knowledge and helping you to become more flexible and resourceful. Your character will have another great alternative foundation on which you can rely to solve a lot of problems. You will have a wonderful time walking in various fields and smelling novel flowers. With language, we can express our hopes, desires, dreams and fears. With language, we can pass our knowledge, experience, skills and points of view. That’s why we can say that when you learn a new language, you double the benefit of your life time as you win another life!<br>A major example for demonstrating this bridge is late Egyptian president Anwar Al-Sadat. Not only was Al-Sadat a great leader but he was also a brilliant linguist (He spoke more than 5 languages).This made him greatly tolerant and understanding towards the other cultures. While he was responsible for breaking out war between Egypt and Israel again, he, with his partners, managed to reach the durable Camp David Accords which ended war between the two countries up till now and saved thousands of lives. Through his initiatives, he taught a lot of people how to take significant steps towards peaceful coexistence and reciprocal appreciation. He couldn’t have done so without his profound knowledge of other languages. He properly used this lingual bridge to conceive the others’ attitude and to convey his perspective to them. Sure he learnt that when you can’t dictate your conditions, you should negotiate and do something like give and take without violating your constant values. I can’t imagine that he reached this ability without navigating in literature and spending good deal of his precious time with remarkable names like Shakespeare, Dickens and Arthur Miller. He was exceptionally interested in history but it is completely another thing when you read history from another point of view. No wonder he could figure out a lot of dilemmas.</p>
<p>INFORMATIVE &amp; LOGICAL</p>
<p>[ ] what do you usually do during weekends?<br>well, I usually do some exercise during weekends. I go hiking every two weeks. last week I went to Big Basin Redwood state park in Saratoga, California. Hiking is a really good way to stay healthy and fit, especially for people like me, who have to sit in front of computer and do programming five days a week. Also, I can make a lot of new friends during hiking. So even though it’s tiring, I really enjoy hiking. But if it’s rainy, I would just put my feet up and read a book.</p>
<p>[ ] Do you prefer Saturdays or Sundays, why?<br>I prefer Saturdays. For Saturdays, I can plan for a one-day or two-day trip. But Sundays are the end of the weekend and I need to prepare for Monday’s weekly meeting. Also, I can stay up very late to watch a movie or read a book However on Sunday evenings I have to go to bed early since I need to get up very early the next morning. So I would say Saturdays are better than Sundays.</p>
<p>[ ] Do the old and young have the same weekend activities? Why or why not?<br>I don’t think so. Most young people are stressed out from work, they usually go hiking or take a trip to chill up themselves. However, considering the senior’s physical conditions, it’s unlikely for them to be involved in some outdoor activities, like hiking, Marathon or skating. Also, Most old people are retired, so their weekends almost mean the same to them just as weekdays.</p>
<p>[ ] What is your hobby? (who + when + where + why + how)<br>My hobby is shopping. I usually go shopping when I am free, especially during weekends. Every time after buying a lot of clothes back, I feel so excited and cannot wait to try them on again. Even though sometimes I just do window-shopping, I still feel good. My favorite shopping place is outlet, where the products are cheap and cheerful. I have to say shopping is the best way to relax myself and it’s really amazing.</p>
<p>[ ] Say something about your hometown?<br>I came from China. My hometown is Guangshui, located in the middle part of China. it’s about 2 hours by flight to Shanghai. Guangshui has four very distinct seasons. It’s freaking cold in winter to the point that the wind can really chill me to the bone, while summers are always as hot as hell. However, surrounded by mountains and rivers, it’s a really gorgeous place especially in autumn, when golden hillsides cascade into sparkling rivers. Right now I really miss the breath-taking natural beauty of my hometown.</p>
<p>[ ] what’s your hometown popular for?<br>My hometown Guangshui, in Chinese, it means town of water. As you can see from the name, it’s popular because there are a lot of rivers across the town including a branch of Yellow River. When I was young, in the summer evenings, almost all the families in the town went to swimming in the river. Bach then, the water was so clean to the point that we could directly drink it. However, because of pollution, all the rivers have been turned color.</p>
<p>[ ] what do you like most about your hometown<br>My favorite is dim sum. In my hometown, people always have their breakfast outside, where there are a lot of stands for different kinds of breakfast, like pan-fried dumplings, porridge of different flavors, and soup noodles. It’s very similar to a farmer’s market. Just that they serve dim-sum instead. Every morning around 9:00 am, people would gather in the downtown to have their breakfast and start their day of work after that.</p>
<p>[ ] Do you think your hometown is a good place for young people?<br>Honestly, I do not think so. It’s a really rural place, where young people can hardly find a good job. Also, the lifestyle in my hometown is very slow and relaxing. it’s better for young people to step out of the comfort zone and go to big cities like New York, Shanghai where there are a lot of competitions. Only in that way they can improve themselves to a higher level.</p>
<p>[ ] How do people make a living there?<br>Most people in my hometown farm for a living. Because there are a lot of lands that are good for growing vegetables and rice. For example, my parents cultivated a lot of tomatoes, cucumbers and cabbage. It’s also because that most people learnt farming from the older generations and that’s basically the only thing they are confident with. People can not profit much from Agriculture, but at least it can cover their daily expenses. Unlike people from big city, farmers are not crazy for luxury brands.</p>
<p>[ ] How long have you been living in your hometown?<br>I lived there until I was 18, when I went to college in a big city. It’s always the most holy place in my heart. It’s the place always reminding me of the happy time when I was a kid.</p>
<p>[ ] Do you like eating fruits, why?<br>Yes, I love fruits very much. I basically eat fruits every day. Sometimes I take bananas and apples as breakfast. Firstly, fruits are rich in vitamins, fibers and water, which is good for us to stay healthy. Secondly, after a day of work in front of computer, it’s really relaxing and exciting to see so many fruits of different colors on the table. I like oranges, kiwis, apples, mango, all of them together is really colorful.</p>
<p>[ ] What’s your name?<br>My Chinese name is Chunli Yu, you can call me my English name Emma. Chunli is my given name, it means prosperous spring. Since I was born in Spring, my mom hope my life would be as prosperous as spring. I can be as tough and optimistic as trees.</p>
<p>[ ] Are you studying or working?<br>I am working at Aetna, an insurance company. I am a data engineer in the data science team. It’s been two years since I started working.</p>
<p>[ ] What do you do during your job?<br>Most of my projects are to extract insurance data from different sources, so that the data sets can be analyzed more efficiently in our platform which is Spark. I actually automated this process including data extraction, cleansing, and normalization by writing python scripts. We also talked a lot to the business team, to help them make decisions based on insight from our analytic results. </p>
<p>[ ] what is your favorite subject when you were in the middle school?<br>My favorite subject was classical Chinese. The main reason I like it so much is because the classical Chinese is really efficient. The articles in classical Chinese are always around 100 words. To express the same meaning, it costs 1000 words in modern Chinese. Besides, in the old time, Chinese articles are taken as songs. So most of the sentences follow the similar rhythm and rhyme. Even though the classical Chinese is very hard to understand, I still think it’s amazing.</p>
<p>[ ] What’s your major?<br>My major is computer science. I got both my master’s degree and bachelor’s degree in Computer science. I also did a minor in Japanese, which is a good addition to my engineering study.</p>
<p>[ ] Do you like your major, why?<br>I do, I feel so lucky that I chose computer science. I did not have much access to computers before going to college because I could not afford it. Computer to me is just like candies to a kid who do not have money to buy it. That’s also the reason why I value a lot this opportunity to study computer science. I ranked second in my major when graduated. Not only it makes me more confident, But also it help me get a good job which can support me quite well.</p>
<p>[ ] Do you want to change for another job?<br>Yes, I am actually thinking about it. My current job is very cozy and coworkers are very nice. We always hang out and have a drink after work. However, based on some coworker’s experiences in my department, it’s very hard for me to get promoted and gain much progress in the next ten years. I want to get a more challenging job in a startup so that I can take on more responsibilities and grow faster.</p>
<p>[ ] What do you usually do everyday?<br>Most time I was working in the office. I am not an early bird and get up at around 8:00am, then I make myself a cup of coffee and go to work. I always have lunch in the cafeteria inside the office building. evenings are my favorite part of one day. I get back home at around 5:00pm, then I usually do yoga for half an hour, call my friends or family, then make a dinner. After that I just put my feet up and watch some videos.</p>
<p>[ ] Is there anything you like to do everyday?<br>Yes, I do yoga every day, not quite long. It’s a really good way to refresh myself after a day of work. Also, it helps me keep fit, my body is more flexible than before. </p>
<p>[ ] Do you do housework?<br>Yes, I do. Ever since I was a little girl, I did a lot of housework including cleaning the room, do the laundry and wash the dishes. Because my mom was always busy and tired, I really enjoyed doing housework to ease her burden. Also, I got the habit of organizing stuff and took good care of myself. When I went to college that was far away from home, I could adjust the new environment pretty fast. Doing housework is actually a way to relax myself.</p>
<p>[ ] What changes are brought into housework by modern technology?<br>Obviously a lot, to me, there are three modern technologies that really make my life easier. One is washing machine, when I was young, all my family’s clothes were hand washed, which was really tiring and time-consuming. The second one is dish washer, every time after dinner, I would just throw all the dirty dishes to the washer and throw myself down on the sofa. The third one is vacuum cleaner. DYSON V8 is my favorite. it’s very light and wireless. So we do not need to plug in and plug out when we change rooms. Even though it’s kind of expensive, like around $250, I would still highly recommend it because it’s worth the price. In these situations, modern technology is really fantastic.</p>
<p>[ ] What is your future plan?<br>I am planning to relocate to Canada. As an international student, it’s really hard to get the green card in United States no matter how much I like this place. My home country China, is developing rapidly, especially in the fields of computer science. However, there are still some bias towards women. For example, they would call girls like me left-over ladies just because I do not have a boyfriend at this age. They prefer to hire a male in the workplace. Since Canada has similar culture as United States, I would like to relocate to Canada.</p>
<p>[ ] To what extend do you think that people should always have future plans?<br>My opinion is that people should always have future plans. If they have a big picture about their life, people tend to be more optimistic and self motivated. Without plans, one will certainly be quite passive when confronting some accidents or unhappy moments. So it’s advisable for every one to plan ahead.</p>
<p>[ ] Can you speak any other language besides English?<br>Except for English, I can also speak Japanese. I did a minor in Japanese during my bachelor’s study. I passed the Japanese N2 Language test, which is the second highest test for Japanese learners. Just like Band 8 in IELTS. But I have not spoken Japanese for 4 years, it will take time for me to pick it up.</p>
<p>[ ] How important is it for people to master several second languages?<br>I think it’s very important to master at least one second language. As we know, language is the bridge to other cultures. It’s very essential in communication and mutual understanding among diverse nations and varied cultures. When we learn a certain new language we will find ourselves exposed to a different culture, a different way of thinking and a different heritage. This brand new concept will help widen our scope of knowledge and open our mind. Therefore, mastering several second languages including English is quite necessary for people, particularly for younger generation.</p>
<p>[ ] What kind of clothes do you like most?<br>I like sports clothes very much, especially those dry-fit ones. I always go hiking during weekends and practice yoga in evenings. Sport clothes are really flexible and comfortable for doing exercises. Besides, it’s very easy to take care of, I can just throw them to washing machine instead of hand wash. What’s more, the sports clothes are always in the trends, unlike other kind clothes, even after 5 year, it’s still stylish to wear sports clothes.</p>
<p>[ ] What clothes are more popular in your country now?<br>It’s been a long time since I came here, so I am not quite clear about the fashion trend in China. From the pictures posted on social medias like wechat, instagram, I think Chinese people are really into sports clothes. The brands they like most are Nike, New Balance and Adidas. I think that’s a big progress, it shows that people care more about how comfortable the clothes are and tend to work out more than before.</p>
<p>[ ] What do you pay more attention to when buying clothes, the price, quality or brand?<br>I care more about the price and quality when playing an order for clothes. There is no doubt that brand clothes usually have better quality and more stylish. If I am rich enough, I would browse in the shops with big names. Sometimes I go shopping in outlets for clothes that are cheap and cheerful. （物美价廉）</p>
<p>[ ] Do you like shopping?<br>Yes, definitely. Shopping is a really good way to relax myself. Every time after buying a lot of clothes back, I feel so excited and cannot wait to try them on again. Window-shopping is fun too, I can keep track of the fashion trend. However, I am not into net-shopping for clothes because it’s really hard to tell if the product is as good as showed in the picture. Even though more people think online-shopping is more convenient, I still think solid shopping is a better experience.</p>
<p>[ ] Where do you go shopping? with whom?<br>I always drive to outlet for shopping. The main reason is that the products there are usually cheap and cheerful. For example, last weekend I bought a sweater with 20 bucks. Outlets are located outside of the city, where it’s easier to find a parking lot. Unlike most people they like to shop together, I always go shopping by myself. I browse around very quickly while my friends enjoy looking around slowly. I am into sports clothes while my friends prefer some clothes that are more girly, like dresses. I like to go to outlets while most of my Chinese friends like to shop in big malls with luxury brands inside. So it’s just easier for me to go shopping alone in outlets.</p>
<p>[ ] Do you usually go shopping in one place or in different places?<br>It depends what I intend to buy. If I need to buy some clothes, I would go to outlet or Nordstorm Rack. When I need to buy vegetables, I would go to farmer’s market or target. There is a target near my place, I frequently go there. In the case I need cosmetics, I just shop online. </p>
<p>[ ] How often do you go shpping?<br>It all depends whether I am busy or not. If I am working on some urgent projects, I may focus on my work and go shopping three months later. Otherwise I go shopping every month.</p>
<p>[ ] What is your favorite food?<br>My favorite food is </p>
<p>[ ] What do you think about fast food?<br>I like fast food, especially in-n-out. the food served there is very fresh and there are always people waiting in the line. Compared to eating in fancy restaurants, fast food is more cost effective. we can have a rich lunch with less than $10. Also, it’s faster than dinning in big restaurants. we can just drive through and leave with food we ordered. it’s really convenient. unhealthy as it is, I still like fast food because it’s cost-effective, time-saving and tasty.</p>
<p>[ ] Do you cook?<br>Yes, but just cook for myself. Without discussion, my family and my friends have the totally same opinion on the food I cooked. They said disgusting. Sometimes to make me feel better, they would say: eatable. They will try any means to stop me cooking. </p>
<p>[ ] Do you have breakfast everyday?<br>Not really. I am not a morning person and get up at around 8:00am. Then I go to work with a cup of coffee and a piece of bread. If time permitting, I will make myself a fried egg.</p>
<p>[ ] How important is breakfast?<br>Breakfast is surely very important for people. Firstly, a good breakfast can offer the necessary energy and nutrition people need for the whole morning. What’s more, if people do not have breakfast for a long time, they may probably get sick. Finally, some people do not have breakfast but eat more at lunch, it’s easy for them to gain weight. And that’s really bad for their health.</p>
<p>[ ] Why don’t some people have breakfast?<br>Some people get up too late and there is no time left for them to have breakfast. Also, some people prefer to work out in the morning, It’s better for them not having breakfast before they do exercise. And they probably do not have any appetite to eat after working out.</p>
<p>[ ]  Do you live in a flat or a house?<br>I am staying in a house that is 3-floor. The first floor is the garage, Dining room and living room are on the second one. bedrooms are located on the third floor. My room is a guest room. </p>
<p>[ ] How many Chinese families living in the house?<br>including me, there are 3 people in the house.</p>
<p>[ ] What can you see from the window of your room?<br>Looking out of my window, on the left is a local highway. In the center is a 2-floor office building that is for government use. there is a railway station on the right. The location is not that good because house prices in California is really expensive. As you can imagine, it’s very noisy with windows open. In the beginning, I could not fall asleep because of the siren of the train and the sound of driving cars. After I get used to the noise, I prefer to sleep with the windows open. </p>
<p>[ ] What are there on the walls of your room?<br>Since I just moved in, I have not decorate it too much. I am thinking put a picture on the wall to my bed .</p>

<p>[ ] Which one is your favorite?<br>I like to take a bus. Firstly, it’s relatively safer. There have been a lot of reports about kidnapped girls by taxi. As more people on the bus, if anything happens, I can call for help at least. Secondly, it’s more economical.</p>

It’s beneficial for the environment and it’s a cheaper option for commuting to work. People can get to the destination by spending only very little money and without worrying about parking. However, public transportation has some shortcomings; like that the vehicles are over-crowded during the rush hours and quite time-consuming.</p>
<p>[ ] Are there any traffic problems in your city?<br>Yes, especially during spring festivals. The street is packed with cars and people. Either part cannot move at all. cars are beeping and people are complaining. With the development of the local economy, more and more people have purchased their own cars while the roads are not wider. To my opinion, it’s really not necessary for most Chinese people to have cars. Because the public transportation is really convenient and affordable in China. Most people buy cars just trying to show off. Just like most people are on fire for brands. Sometimes they are not aware of what they really need. It’s part of the side effects of the rapid development after all.</p>

On one hand, Mahjong plays an important role in helping the senior to remain socially connected. On the other hand, Mahjong is based on math, Mahjong is based on math and a smart game that can help the old generation stay active and avoid Alzheimer disease.</p>
<p>[ ] What’s the difference between the ways of relaxation today and ten years ago?<br>Ten years ago, people visited each other and chat with other people face to face a lot while nowadays people play mahjong a lot and travel around to relax themselves. Take my experience as an example, ten years ago, whenever my mom had time, she would bring me to visit my aunties and neighbors. with the development of the local economy, more and more people can afford the flight ticket and enjoying traveling around. My parents like to visit different places. when they are at home, they usually play mahjong. </p>
<p>[ ] Do you like traveling?<br>Yes, absolutely. Traveling is a good way to relax myself. The stress of work and daily demands can distract us from what is actually meaningful and interesting. Taking a break from the daily hustle and bustle is essential for your mind to refresh, recharge and rejuvenate.<br> It also helps widen my scope of knowledge and open my mind, making ourselves more aware and open to new things.

People usually get at least 7 days off work. It is the time for the whole family to reunite together, which is similar with Christmas Day to the westerners.  This festival used to be observed to fight against the monster “Nian” who liked to eat children and livestock. The monster is afraid of red color and loud sound. Therefore, people decorated their houses in red and set off fireworks to scare it away. That’s also the reason why people give out the red-pocket money to their children so that the  monster dare not to approach their kids.</p>
<p>[ ] Do people in China also celebrate western festivals.<br>Yes, they do. Festivals like Christmas and Thanksgiving, are also celebrated in China. However, most of them are taken as valentine’s day. People give out chocolate and flowers to their boyfriends or girlfriends. Also, those festivals are used to boost sales.

I got so excited when my manger give me the ticket when he could not go. I went to the concert although it was a weekday and the concert started at 7:00pm. The whole stadium was filled with excited fans waiting for the showing up of Sting. CEO of oracle walked onstage first and introduced Sting, who quickly opened with “If I ever lose my faith in you”.

There are also different kind of competitions for plaza dancing among different cities.</p>
<p>[ ] What kind of sports do you like best?<br>I like hiking a lot. I go hiking every two weeks. last week I went to Big Basin Redwood state park in Saratoga, California. Hiking is a really good way to stay healthy and fit, especially for people like me, who have to sit in front of computer and do programming five days a week.

<p>(1) <b>The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The diagrams show two ways of building the houses to avoid being flooded.</p>
<p>The most noticeable difference is that they show flood protection with and without a stopbank.<br>The methods can also be compared in terms of the height of stilts.</p>
<p>Looking at the information in more detail, the stopbank in the first diagram plays an important role in stopping river water from flooding homes. The stopbank is a mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year flood level and acts as a flood barrier. If the internal ponding is higher than the potential flood level, then a floodgate beneath the stopbank can be opened to allow this pondeing to drain off into the river. Nearby houses are also built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater. </p>
<p>When there is no stopbank, as shown in the second diagram, there will be nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put buildings on higher stilts. The height of the stilts is measured so that the floor of the house is 300mm above the 100-year flood level. This measurement is called the ‘freeboard’.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The map shows two potential locations (S1 and S2) for a new supermarket in a town called Garlsdon.  </p>
<p>The most noticeable difference between the two sites is that S1 is outside the town, whereas S2 is in the town centre.<br>The sites can also be compared in terms of access by road or rail, and their positions relative to three smaller towns.  </p>
<p>Looking at the information in more detail, S1 is in the countryside to the north west of Garlsdon, but it is still close to the residential area of the town. S2 is also near the housing area, which surrounds the town centre.   There are main roads from Garlsdon town centre to Hindon, Bransdon and Cransdon, but this is a no traffic zone, so there would be no access to S2 by car. By contrast, S1 lies on the main road to Hindon, but it would be more difficult to reach from Bransdon and Cransdon. Both supermarket sites are close to the railway that runs through Garlsdon from Hindon to Cransdon.</p>

<p>(3) <b>The diagrams below show some principles of house design for cool and for warm climates.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The diagrams show how house designs differ according to climate.</p>
<p>The most noticeable difference is the shape of the roof.<br>The designs also differ with regard to the windows and the building materials.</p>
<p>Looking at the information in more detail, the cool climate house has a high-angled roof, which allows sunlight to enter through the window. By contrast, the roof of the warm climate house has a peak in the middle and the roof overhangs to shade the windows. </p>
<p>Secondly, the cool climate house only has windows on one side which faces the direction of the sun, while the warm climate house has windows on both sides which are shaded from the sun. By opening the windows at night, the house designed for the warm house can be ventilated. </p>
<p>Finally, insulation and thermal building materials are used in cool climates to reduce heat loss, whereas insulation and reflective materials are used to keep heat out in cool climates.</p>

<p>Simon 范文<br>The two pictures compare the current layout of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the same living space.</p>
<p>We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.</p>
<p>(missing parts)The most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and the living room, along with the current staircase and under-stair storage cupboard. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.</p>
<p>(adding parts)To replace the curent staight staircase, a new set of windowing stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and the kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally, the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture. </p>

<p>To begin with, typically 1 or 2 eggs are laid every three days by the adult female bees.<br>After 9 or 10 days, each egg hatches and nymph appears. During the third stage, the nymph grows in size and sheds its skin for a total of three times. This moulting first takes place 5 days after the egg hatches, then 7 days, and again another 9 days. </p>
<p>The final two steps show how the young adult honey bees become the mature adults.<br>When the final moulting stage finishes, the young adult honey bee emerges.<br>Just only 4 days later it reaches full maturity and the new life cycle starts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The flow chart illustrates the process of recycling waste paper.<br>It is clear that there are six distinct stages in this system, from the initial collection of waste paper to the eventual production of usable paper.</p>
<p>To begin with, the waste paper is gathered either from the public paper banks or directly from businesses. Next, the paper will be sorted by hand and separated acoording to its grade, with any paper that is not suitable for recyling being removed. The third stage is responsible for transporting the graded paper to the paper mill. </p>
<p>The following two stages show how the collected paper is cleaned.<br>During the fourth stage, the paper is cleaned, pulped and the other objects such as staples are taken out.<br>Following this, all remnants of ink and glue are removed from the paper at the de-inking stage. Finally, with the help of the paper making machine, the end product-usable paper-is made. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The picture illustrates that water passes from ocean to air to land during the natural process known as water cycle. It is clear that there are three distinct stages during this cycle, from the initial ocean water evaporation to the eventual back flow of water to the sea.</p>
<p>To begin with, the heat from the sun causes water to evaporate. As shown on the diagram, 80 percent of water vapor comes from the oceans. When the water vapor becomes condensed enough, clouds form in the sky. Next, during the precipitation stage, clouds turn into either rain or snow.</p>
<p>The last stage shows how water runs from ground back into the earth.<br>Both the snow-thawing water and rainwater may take various paths. Some of it return to the oceans via “surface runoff”. Otherwise, rainwater may filter through the ground, reaching the impervious layer of the earth.  Salt water intrusion takes place just before groundwater passes into the oceans, which is when the cycle is complete</p>

<p>The picture illlustrates the process used by Australian Bureau of Meteorology to forecast the weather.<br>There are 4 main stages in the system, from the initial weather information gathering to the eventual broadcast. </p>
<p>Looking at the first two stages in the process, there are three ways of collecting weather data and three ways of analyzing it.<br>To begin with, incoming information is received from the outer space, on land or at sea, using satellite, radar and drifting buoy respectively.<br>Next, all the data is mapped on screen, chart, and photo for further analysis and forecasting. </p>
<p>The following two stages shows how the weather data reaches the public.<br>Stage three of the process is when the information is put in order and prepared for broadcast. This is done through computer which sends all necessary data to the fourth stage.<br>At this point, the weather data is delivered (released) to the general public on TV, on the radio or as a recorded telephone announcement. </p>

<p>Looking at the information in more detail, only 5% of the hotel’s visitors rated its customer service as excellent in 2005. This figure rose to 28% in 2019. While only 14% of guests described customer service in the hotel as good in 2005, almost three times as many people gave this rating five years later.</p>
<p>With regard to negative feedback, the proportion of guests who considered the hotel’s customer service to be poor fell from 21% in 2005 to only 12% in 2010. Similarly, the proportion of people who thought customer service was very poor dropped from 15% to only 4% over the 5-year period. a fall in the number of ‘satisfactory’ ratings in 2010 reflects the fact that more people gave positive responses to the survey in that year.</p>

<p>(7) <b>The table below gives information about the underground railway systems in six cities.</b></p>
<p>The chart compares the six networks in terms of their age, size and the number of people who use them each year.</p>
<p>Overall, the three oldest underground systems are larger and serve significantly more passengers than the newer systems. <br>It is also noticeable that the usage rate of Washington DC one was the lowest considering its size and passengers per year.</p>
<p>Looking at the information in more detail, the London underground is the oldest opened in 1863. It’s also the largest system, with 394 kilometres of route. The second largest system, in Paris, is only about half the size of the London underground, with 199 kilometres of route. However, it serves more people per year. While only third in terms of size and age, the Tokyo system is easily the most used, with 1927 million passengers per year. </p>
<p>Of the three newer networks, the Washington DC underground is the most extensive, with 126 kilometres of route, compared to only 11 kilometres and 28 kilometres for the Kyoto and Los Angeles systems respectively. The Los Angeles network is the newest, having opened in 2001, while the Kyoto network is the smallest and serves only 45 million passengers per year. </p>
